The purpose of Campaign behavior assessment prediction system is to evaluate campaign activates and predict the result of election according to sentiment analysis of Twitter. The CBAPS could be divided into two major components, which are evaluation and prediction. The evaluation of campaign is used to provide the proposals of campaign activates, such as campaign speeches and televised debates, depending on the real-time result of sentiment analysis of Twitter in order to better support for campaign. Consequently, through combination result of evaluation and real-time sentiment analysis, the prediction system has the capability to predict election result.<BR><BR>\n",

Primarily, collecting the previous twitter data related to campaign topic and labeling the dataset in order to generate a training dataset cloud be the first subobjective.

For the data analyst, the significance is to propose a kind of model in which\n",

In addition, there are not only decision system but also prediction system in this system, which could save a lot of manpower and time in the process of election. basically, this system could save lots of money and time. On the other hand, there are many television programs associated with situation analysis of election during the election. One of the most relevant indicators is public opinion polls used to evaluate the victory probability of every candidates. Accurate analysis of the election situation of the TV programs can generally harvest more audience rating and bring more profits for the television station. This new system could assist tv station to present some campaign advices as well as obtain more accurate prediction of election result in different phase of election in order to create the much more audience rating.<BR><BR>\n",
        "Likewise, in the aspect of candidate, every candidate would spend much lots of money on the whole phase of election. a lot of money is spent in labor costs. This system used in decision support and predict could be as a comprehensive consultant to streamline the team. For instance, the employee who is responsible to survey support and decision consultants would be unnecessary in the campaign team. Surveying support rating and data collection also take lots of time and unable to give timely feedback. As a comparison, assigning all these tasks to a computer will save a lot of time and obtain timely feedback. Furthermore, the computer has the higher accuracy of prediction and better decision support through data analysis, which could charge the current status of election and improve the election victory rating."

However, this model does not have a decision support system. Hence, the prediction of presidential election without decision support system does not have the strong applicability in practical. Undeniably, the model presented by Ramteke et al. (2016) possesses great significance in algorithm comparison and research. Compared with that model, the model added the decision support system could be used in the actual campaign to assist candidate to victory the election.
